The original data covers years 2012 - 2017 and includes information on employer, position, wage offered, job posting history, employee education and past visa history, associated lawyers, and final decision. It was collected and distributed by the US Department of Labor. The dataset we will be using is a small subset of the original dataset.\n","\n","**Context:** A permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In most instances, before the U.S. employer can submit an immigration petition to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the employer must obtain a certified labor certification application from the DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\n","\n","The goal of the below data analysis is checking the general trend in Visa applications, the most popular citizenships, employers, cities and finally, predicting the application decision based on the chosen features, etc.\n","\n","The current dataset used in this notebook contains 2000 rows.\n","\n","***Reference:*** https://www.kaggle.com/elzawie/us-permanent-visa-applications-v1-1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question: Read data using Pandas
